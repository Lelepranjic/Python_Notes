    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library. <br>\n",
    "Python is considered both as a scripting and programming language by most developers as it has support of scripting language as well.\n",
    "The reason for considering it as a \"scripting language\" is because of the ease of coding, automation, deployment and various other reasons. The topic of whether python is a scripting language or just proramming language is hugely debated till now by developers.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<u>Keywords to go through in above definition : </u><br>\n",
    "<b>1. Interpreted Language :</b> Interpreted Language specifies that a language can be freely and directly be executed without the need of compiling the code. In case of python, when in *interpreter mode* , one can get the output then and there itself without the need of saving the file and then compiling it. This means even the errors are denoted then and there at that line only and it wll not wait till the completion of the code to tell all the errors in one go. One can go to interpreter by searching for \"python\" in windows search or typing it in cmd or terminal to directly enter it. In case of windows, if the *system environment variables* has been configured properly, you will see the python version and the prompt symbol \">>>\". <br>\n",
    "A <b>\">>>\"</b> (called 'python prompt') specifies an active line waiting for your command, while \"...\" specifies a continued line of code (in case of for loop, if-else, and basically any statements or code that is followed by a colon \":\").<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Dynamically typed language :</b> Dynamically typed language in layman language means that python doesn't statically limit the coder to one data type for any variable unlike in case of C,C++ or Java. <br><br>&nbsp;<b><u>Eg:</u></b> In case of C or C++ lang, if we declare : \n",
    "\n",
    ">\n",
    "> > #include <stdio.h><br>\n",
    "> > main() <br>\n",
    "> > { <br>\n",
    "> > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a; <br>\n",
    "> > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a = \"hello\"; <br>\n",
    "> > } \n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;you cannot declare, a = \"hello\" or a = 1.2, as 'a' variable is only int &nbsp;type and it will give error. We can only declare 'a' as a = 79, for example or integer type.\n",
    "<br><br>But in case of python, we directly declare \"value\" and not the \"data-type\" because python by default understands the data-type based on the value you assigned to the variable. This also means you can change the data-type of the variable to any type. This is why python is called \"Dynamically typed\" and not \"statically typed\".\n",

    "<br>\n",

    "<b>4.

Here these functions are imported using libraries or modules by python which are basically classes which have these functions which act like objects.<br><br> For example, we have functions for string data-type where-in string data-type also acts like a class/module/library and offers functions like lower(), upper(), join(), etc {More about this later}.\n",

The [python interpreter]() reads the code from the 1st line to the last line provided there aren't any jump statements like function calls or decision/conditional statements or looping statements that would make a piece of code loop again and again until a specific condition is met.

    "<br>Mutli-line commenting means commenting multiple lines in one go. This is useful when you want to comment out a whole specific block of codes (multiple code statements) unlike just one or two statements. For example you can comment out a whole for-loop if you think it's causing errors in your code and see if your code works with it or without it.<br><br>\n",
    "You can do multi-line commenting in python using triple quotes <code>\"\"\".</code>. These triple-quotes are actually unlike # (single comments) not ignored by the python interpreter because, they aren't comments (which the interpreter ignores) but the string data-type. Tripe-quotes basically are multi-line strings which if not assigned to a variable or used in print() function converts the whole code-block to a string which isn't outputted anywhere. So this code-block acts as a commented block but in traditional sense it is not comments but string datatype. To get started, just type everything inside the triple quotes and enclose it by them.<br>\n",

    "<br><b><u>(iii.) Indexing and slicing strings in Python :</u></b><br>\n",
    "<ul><li> <u>Definition of Index/Indices</u></li><ul> :\n",
    "<br>It is a common method for keeping track of data so that it can be accessed quickly. Like an index in a book, it is a numeric value in which each entry contains the name of the item or element and its location. However, computer-based indexes may point to a physical location on a disk or to a logical location that points elsewhere to the actual location.<br>\n",
    "Indices (plural of 'index') start from 0 (zero) and go on to n-1, where 'n' is the number of characters in the string in this case. For eg: the string \"hello\" has n = 5 value as \"hello\" has 5 characters, hence the indices will start from 0 and go on till n-1, i.e, 5 - 1 = 4.<br>\n",
    "In python, indexing is represented as follows, say : a = \"hello\"; then a[index_number] is the syntax of using indices for string (as well as lists which will be explained later). So in this case, a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3] and a[4] are indices of the variable 'a'. Each of these indices, hold a character of that string assigned to the variable. Therefore, for a = \"hello\", a[0]=>'h', a[1]=>'e',a[2]=>'l', a[3]=>'l', a[4]=>'o'. We don't have a[5] as the length of \"hello\" is 5, and indices range from 0 to n-1 as I said before, so here it is 0 to 4 indices. Similar example : b = \"Name\", here indices of 'b' from 0 to 3 where, b[0]='N', b[1]='a', b[2]='m' and b[3]='e'. <br><br>\n",
    "Unlike in C/C++, Python also has negative indices as well, meaning if a = \"hello\", then it will have that many negative indices as well, meaning, indices from -1 to -5 (as \"hello\" has 5 letters in it), but notice that the positive indices are start from 0 to n-1, or 5-1=4 (0 to 4 in case of \"hello\"). So negative indices are represented in the following way : a[-5], a[-4], a[-3], a[-2] and a[-1].\n",
    "<br> So what's the difference between positive indices and negative indices you may think?\n",
    "<br> Negative indices return characters from the other end or the right-end. This is useful when you got to print values from the other end of the string or don't exactly know what the last character of the string is. Eg : a=\"hello\"; then a[-5]=>\"h\",a[-4]=>\"e\",a[-3]=>\"l\",a[-2]=>\"l\",a[-1]=>\"o\".<br>\n",
    "So from the above you can understand that :<br>\n",
    "<br> a[0] => a[-5] => \"h\";\n",
    "<br> a[1] => a[-4] => \"e\";\n",
    "<br> a[2] => a[-3] => \"l\";\n",
    "<br> a[3] => a[-2] => \"l\";\n",
    "<br> a[4] => a[-1] => \"o\";\n",
    "<br><br> So the following indices hold the same value and can be used as per our likings or situation. Sometimes it's easier to use the negative indices while sometimes it's easier to use the positive indices (like in most cases) or in some cases it's easier to use both.\n",
    "<br> <br>NOTE : I am using \"=>\" instead of \"=\" for a[0]=>\"h\" because \"=\" (equal to) is an assignment operator and will show error if you use a[0]=\"h\" in our case, I am just trying to make you understand that a[0] holds the value \"h\" and this can only be presented using : print(a[0]).\n",

Here even though we just used [<i>start</i>:<i>stop</i>] in a[0:3], the <i>step</i> parameter was by default set to 1, i.e. in the back-end python was executing a[0:3:1], because by default, the <i>step</i> parameter is set at 1, when we use both <i>start</i> and <i>stop</i> parameters inside the square brackets.</li></ul>\n",
    " <ul><li> <i>step</i> parameter is used for skipping the characters or stepping on them as we count from left to right.

    " <ul><li>In case two parameters are given then python only considers them as [<i>Start</i>:<i>Stop</i>] with <i>Step</i> set at 1 by default in the back-end by python itself. Eg : a[0:4]=>\"appl\" (From 0th index to n-1 (4-1=3) index).</li></ul>\n",

    "<li> <b>\"for\"</b> is a keyword and is used by us to let python know that we are using a \"for-loop\". The characteristic of for loop is that, it has a beginning, an end and in some cases a skip value (more about these later). But, \"for\" is same as in C language, we type \"for\" and python interpreter knows okay a \"for loop\" is going to be executed here.</li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li> <b>looping_variable</b> here is \"i\", just how we had in C or C++ langauge. It can be any variable, it doesn't really matter. But make sure you are using the same variable and not some other variable if you want to use the changing values of \"i\" as in this case. Meaning, I used <b>print(i)</b> not print(k) or anything else, since only variable \"i\" is changing from values 0 to 9 not any other variable.</li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li> <b>\"in\"</b> is a keyword and is used with secondary or container data-types (list, arrays, tuples, sets, etc are such data-types) mostly to make python interpreter understand that we are talking about the values or elements insde this secondary data type. Understand it in the same way how you understand the english word \"in\". <Br><b>Eg:</b>The apples are \"in\" the basket.<br> Now this basket is the container data-type and using the keyword \"in\" you are going through Apple No. 1, Apple No. 2, etc until the basket gets over. This will be clearer with further examples of \"for-loops\" later.</li>\n",
    "<li> <b>range()</b> function is the most tricky one to understand but let's try our best to understand it. <b>range()</b> is a generator function, meaning it generates a collection or group of numbers containing integers values for a specific range. But on it's own it's not really a secondary-data type but more of it's own data-type called as \"range\" data-type which temporary holds the range of numbers. But on it's own, it's not useful, we need to [type-cast](https://techterms.com/definition/typecasting#:~:text=Terms%20%3A%20Typecasting%20Definition-,Typecasting,an%20integer%20to%20a%20string.) to a secondary data-type or use it in \"for-loops\" using keywords like \"in\" which give access to range of numbers held by this weird unusable data-type.<br><br>The arguments or parameters that range() function accepts are as follows : <br><br><code>range(starting_int_value, ending_int_value, skip_int_value)</code><br><br></li>\n",
    "    ** Here, <b>\"start_int_value\"</b> is the starting point of your range, i.e., where do you want to start your range from.<br>\n",
    "    ** Here, <b>\"ending_int_value\"</b> is the value you want to end your range at, but in range() function  will always return values upto <b>n-1</b> value of the \"ending_int_value\".<br>\n",
    "    ** Here, <b>\"skip_int_value\"</b> acts as the counter, i.e., the decrement or increment manager like how we had <b>i++</b> or <b>i--</b> in C or C++.<br><br>\n",
    "    Now, in this only <b>\"ending_integer_value\"</b> is an argument or a compulisory parameter to be passed inside the range() function and range() function will always return values upto <b>n-1</b> value of the <b>\"ending_int_value\"</b> as mentioned before.
