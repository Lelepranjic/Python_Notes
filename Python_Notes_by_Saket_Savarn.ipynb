    "Hi! My name is [Saket Savarn](outcastdreamer.github.io/)!!<br>I am currently studying in my 3rd Year of B.Tech CSe at REVA University.\n",
    "The reason for me writing and documenting these Python Notes is to make it easier for me to provide the notes for the workshops and my internships where I teach Python frequently.<br>\n",
    "It also is for my reference purposes so that I can refer to all the concepts I have studied and also because it reinforces my python concepts as well.<br>\n",
    "Having said that I am pretty sure there will be bugs, grammatical errors, and few other kinds of errors here and there that I still need to verify and rectify. <br>\n",
    "In case you come across such bugs or errors feel free to email me at saketsavarn07@gmail.com and I will rectify them as soon as possible.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the end I hope the notes are a useful resource to you and that my sessions where helpful in getting you started with python.<br>\n",
    "I am also sorry for the huge delay it takes me in updating these notes. As I said before, I am held busy by my multiple internships and workshops at a time and hence don't get the time to keep updating it, but I still try my best to update it whenever I get the time.\n",

    "## <b><u>1. Introduction to Python</b></u>\n",
    "---\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library. <br>\n",
    "Python is considered both as a scripting and programming language by most developers as it has support of scripting language as well.\n",
    "The reason for considering it as a \"scripting language\" is because of the ease of coding, automation, deployment and various other reasons. The topic of whether python is a scripting language or just proramming language is hugely debated till now by developers.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<u><h3>Keywords to go through in above definition : </h3></u>\n",
    "> **1. Interpreted Language :** Interpreted Language specifies that a language can be freely and directly be executed without the need of compiling the code. In case of python, when in *interpreter mode* , one can get the output then and there itself without the need of saving the file and then compiling it. This means even the errors are denoted then and there at that line only and it wll not wait till the completion of the code to tell all the errors in one go. One can go to interpreter by searching for \"python\" in windows search or typing it in cmd or terminal to directly enter it. In case of windows, if the *system environment variables* has been configured properly, you will see the python version and the prompt symbol \">>>\". <br>\n",
    "A \">>>\" (called 'python prompt') specifies an active line waiting for your command, while \"...\" specifies a continued line of code (in case of for loop, if-else, and basically any statements or code that is followed by a colon \":\").<br><br><br>\n",
    "**2. Dynamically typed language :** Dynamically typed language in layman language means that python doesn't statically limit the coder to one data type for any variable unlike in case of C,C++ or Java. <br><br>&nbsp;<b><u>Eg:</u></b> In case of C or C++ lang, if we declare : \n",
    ">\n",
    "> > #include <stdio.h><br>\n",
    "> > main() <br>\n",
    "> > { <br>\n",
    "> > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a; <br>\n",
    "> > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a = \"hello\"; <br>\n",
    "> > } \n",
    ">\n",
    ">&nbsp;you cannot declare, a = \"hello\" or a = 1.2, as 'a' variable is only int &nbsp;type and it will give error. We can only declare 'a' as a = 79, for example or integer type.\n",
    "<br><br>But in case of python, we directly declare \"value\" and not the \"data-type\" because python by default understands the data-type based on the value you assigned to the variable. This also means you can change the data-type of the variable to any type. This is why python is called \"Dynamically typed\" and not \"statically typed\".\n",

The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program and clears them without need of the programmer to do so on their own.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**4. Functional programming language :** Functional programming language is most of the time built on Object-oriented programming and allows one to use functions to reduce the need of coding, in their place by using functions. Here these functions are imported using libraries or modules by python which are basically classes which have these functions which act like objects.<br><br> For example, we have functions for string data-type where-in string data-type also acts like a class/module/library and offers functions like lower(), upper(), join(), etc {More about this later}.\n",

    "2. It is used in the trending topics like Machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning. This is because any developer can install and import modules/libraries with all the machine learning algorithms already provided in them which can be used as functions (aspect of \"functional prog.\") hence all we need to do is provide the relevant datasets and information and train it by invoking the functions. Python supports all domains of ML, AI and DL like image processing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), chat bots, etc.\n",
    "3. It's used by scientists in scientific researches (like by NASA scientists for space exploration,SUPER Computers, etc).\n",
    "4. It's used for web-developement in back-end using modules like Flask and django.\n",
    "5. It's used in various scripts in hacking and cyber security such as tracking sub-domains of websites, DDOS attacking, etc.\n",
    "6. It's used in data-mining, web scrapping, to download data in back-end in bulk.\n",
    "7. It's used in data-visualization for busiess analytics, etc.\n",

You can directly print the value or the variable holding the value without using the type-specifier for the data-type that value belongs to.

    "<br><b><u>iii.) Indexing and slicing strings in python :</u></b><br>\n",
    "* <u>Definition of Index/Indices</u> :\n",
    "<br>It is a common method for keeping track of data so that it can be accessed quickly. Like an index in a book, it is a numeric value in which each entry contains the name of the item or element and its location. However, computer-based indexes may point to a physical location on a disk or to a logical location that points elsewhere to the actual location.<br>\n",
    "Indices (plural of 'index') start from 0 (zero) and go on to n-1, where 'n' is the number of characters in the string in this case. For eg: the string \"hello\" has n = 5 value as \"hello\" has 5 characters, hence the indices will start from 0 and go on till n-1, i.e, 5 - 1 = 4.<br>\n",
    "In python, indexing is represented as follows, say : a = \"hello\"; then a[index_number] is the syntax of using indices for string (as well as lists which will be explained later). So in this case, a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3] and a[4] are indices of the variable 'a'. Each of these indices, hold a character of that string assigned to the variable. Therefore, for a = \"hello\", a[0]=>'h', a[1]=>'e',a[2]=>'l', a[3]=>'l', a[4]=>'o'. We don't have a[5] as the length of \"hello\" is 5, and indices range from 0 to n-1 as I said before, so here it is 0 to 4 indices. Similar example : b = \"Name\", here indices of 'b' from 0 to 3 where, b[0]='N', b[1]='a', b[2]='m' and b[3]='e'. <br><br>\n",
    "Unlike in C/C++, Python also has negative indices as well, meaning if a = \"hello\", then it will have that many negative indices as well, meaning, indices from -1 to -5 (as \"hello\" has 5 letters in it), but notice that the positive indices are start from 0 to n-1, or 5-1=4 (0 to 4 in case of \"hello\"). So negative indices are represented in the following way : a[-5], a[-4], a[-3], a[-2] and a[-1].\n",
    "<br> So what's the difference between positive indices and negative indices you may think?\n",
    "<br> Negative indices return characters from the other end or the right-end. This is useful when you got to print values from the other end of the string or don't exactly know what the last character of the string is. Eg : a=\"hello\"; then a[-5]=>\"h\",a[-4]=>\"e\",a[-3]=>\"l\",a[-2]=>\"l\",a[-1]=>\"o\".<br>\n",
    "So from the above you can understand that :<br>\n",
    "<br> a[0] => a[-5] => \"h\";\n",
    "<br> a[1] => a[-4] => \"e\";\n",
    "<br> a[2] => a[-3] => \"l\";\n",
    "<br> a[3] => a[-2] => \"l\";\n",
    "<br> a[4] => a[-1] => \"o\";\n",
    "<br><br> So the following indices hold the same value and can be used as per our likings or situation. Sometimes it's easier to use the negative indices while sometimes it's easier to use the positive indices (like in most cases) or in some cases it's easier to use both.\n",
    "<br> <br>NOTE : I am using \"=>\" instead of \"=\" for a[0]=>\"h\" because \"=\" (equal to) is an assignment operator and will show error if you use a[0]=\"h\" in our case, I am just trying to make you understand that a[0] holds the value \"h\" and this can only be presented using : print(a[0]).\n",

    "<Br> So uptil now we have learned about indices in strings. Now moving to the next topic, which is slices. It uses the concept of indices to work. If you remember correctly, if a=\"apple\", then a[0]=>\"a\". Here, we are just using one index, i.e., 0 (zero). But in actual, we can input upto three parameters inside the [ ] (square brackets).\n",
    "<br>The important thing to remember is this :\n",
    " * We can input upto three parameters inside the square brackets [ ].\n",
    " * Out of the three parameters, having at least one value or parameter when using the square brackets [ ] is compulsory (as in a[0]).\n",
    " * So we can use either 1, 2 or upto 3 parameters in square brackets, and each of these parameters is seperated using \"colons\" (:).\n",
    " * The parameters are denoted as follows -> [*start*:*stop*:*step*] (notice the colons been used to seperate the parameters as mentioned in the above point.\n",
    " * *start* parameter decides from which index we are supposed to start.\n",
    " * *stop* parameter decides at which index we are supposed to stop (it goes upto n-1 index, so if we choose say (a[0:3]), we will get characters in \"apple\" from 0th index to 3-1=2 (n-1), so a[0:3] will return \"app\" from 0th, 1st and 2nd index). Here even though we just used [*start*:*stop*] in a[0:3], the *step* parameter was by default set to 1, i.e. in the back-end python was executing a[0:3:1], because by default, the *step* parameter is set at 1, when we use both *start* and *stop* parameters inside the square brackets.\n",
    " * *step* parameter is used for skipping the characters or stepping on them as we count from left to right. For eg : a[0:5:2] (here we have purposefully used '2' as the step so python knows not to use \"1\" as the value for the step parameter by default).<br>So, for a[0:5:2], we will start at a[0]=>\"a\",jump two indices and go to a[2]=>\"p\" and go on until 5-1=4 index,so a[4]=\"e\". So a[0:5:2]=>\"ape\" (Start at 0, stop at 5-1=4, jump two indices every step). Notice how we can use \"5\" as stop value as well because *stop* parameter only considers n-1 as a value.\n",
    " * In case only one parameter is involved (like in a[0]), we get the value at that specific index (\"a\" in \"apple\" for a[0]). Because here, we only consider the value at that specific index, here a[0].\n",
    " * In case two parameters are given then python only considers them as [*Start*:*Stop*] with *Step* set at 1 by default in the back-end by python itself. Eg : a[0:4]=>\"appl\" (From 0th index to n-1 (4-1=3) index).\n",
    " * In case all three parameters are given [*start*:*stop*:*step*] it works the same way as explained in case of a[0:5:2] above.\n",
