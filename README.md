# Python_Notes
You can run the jupyter notebook online and learn while executing codes [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17rIiiqaJVgtQjja44_Bdt_vg0ppateEH?usp=sharing).
<br>If you are new to Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb extension files) and want to learn how to run refer to [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI).
<br>I will be adding html files as well later on but they can only be used for viewing purposes (execution of code isn't possible).
<br>
<br>The reason for using jupyter notebooks is because it helps you add texts and run codes as well at the same time so it acts like an interactive textbook in which you can see the demo at that moment only.
<br> You can email me at saketsavarn07@gmail.com for any queries or doubts as well.
<br> I initially made this for my teaching assistant internship jobs.
<br> Hopefully you find them useful and easy to understand :D
